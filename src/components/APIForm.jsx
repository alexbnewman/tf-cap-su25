                like it currently is.
                So like inputs = ["", "", "", ""] instead of our dictionary (see app.jsx). the way 
                we are mapping here w category/value we are good to use key indexing w/ category!! and make inputInfo a dict.

                ... as opposed to indexing into an array w/ index and worrying that array needs to have info in correct
                order.*/}
